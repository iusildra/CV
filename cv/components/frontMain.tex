    \begin{flushleft}
      Dynamic and enthusiastic student looking for a professionalization contract to gain strong knowledge and capabilities. I am particularly interested in functional programming, as I am currently learning Scala. I plan to continue learning effects frameworks such as Cats Effect and ZIO, or big data processing frameworks like Spark.

  {Assistant Software Engineer}
  {Teads France}
  {Jun. 2022 --- Aug. 2022}
  {
    I worked in an agile workflow on both the back-end and front-end on the new demo console application. I learned about pure functional programming in Scala with the Cats Effect framework, and UI testing with React and Cypress. I handled every feature from start to finish (coding, testing, deployment, maintenance). By the end of the internship, the back-end was fully functional, as was the front-end.

  {Intern}
  {L'Avion Jaune}
  {Jun. 2020}
  {
    L'Avion Jaune is a cartography company located in HÃ©rault, in the south of France. They use light aircrafts to map sites. This internship was my first job experience: I had to develop a web application to automate flight reports. It allowed me to gain a better understanding of web languages and Python.
