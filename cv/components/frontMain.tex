    \begin{flushleft}
      Enthusiastic baby software engineer, I enjoy learning new things and tend to go `in depth' rather than `in breadth'. I love going to meetups and conferences

      \vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
      Scala and functional programming are my current passions even though I recently discovered with Scala.IO's website that CSS can be fun

      \vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
      ArchLinux user, I enjoy using the command line for a better understanding of the tools I'm using and spending hours tweaking my system according to my needs

        \item Setup a whole CI pipeline to test the transcoding process with an automated perceived quality test from Netflix's VMAF
        \item Setup the infrastructure (with Terraform) for the event-driven architecture and the monitoring (Grafana, CloudWatch): event rules, queues, lambdas, alarms\dots
        \item Double run migration to ensure the new service was working correctly
      \end{itemize}
      \item[\ding{226}] Cleaned up and refactored a TypeScript project, with a data-driven approach to avoid regressions (using A/B testing) and library updates.
