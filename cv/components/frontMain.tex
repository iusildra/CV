    \begin{flushleft}
      Enthusiastic baby software engineer, I enjoy learning new things and tend to go `in depth' rather than `in breadth'. I love going to meetups and conferences

      \vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
      Scala and functional programming are my current passions even though I recently discovered with Scala.IO's website that CSS can be fun

      \vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
      ArchLinux user, I enjoy using the command line for a better understanding of the tools I'm using and spending hours tweaking my system according to my needs
